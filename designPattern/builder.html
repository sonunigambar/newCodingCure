<h1>Builder Design Pattern in Java</h1>
<p>The Builder Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that is used to construct complex objects by separating the construction process from the representation. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to build an object step by step or when an object has multiple optional parameters or parts.</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Builder Design Pattern</strong> is like a blueprint for building complicated things in Java. 
    Imagine you are building a house, and there are many things you could includeâ€”like a garden, a swimming pool, 
    or a garage. But you don't need all of these things every time. Sometimes, you just want a simple house with basic features.
</p>
<p>
    Using the Builder pattern, you can choose the parts you want for your house step by step, instead of specifying everything all at once.
</p>

<h2>Why use the Builder Pattern?</h2>
<p>
    When creating an object (like a house or a car), sometimes the object has many options (like the color, size, features, etc.). 
    Instead of listing all the possible options when you create the object, the Builder Pattern lets you specify only what you need, one step at a time.
</p>

<h2>How it works:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> This is the thing you're building. In our example, it's a house.</li>
    <li><strong>Builder:</strong> This is like a helper that helps you build the product step by step. You use this helper to choose the parts you want.</li>
    <li><strong>Director (Optional):</strong> Sometimes, there's a person who guides the building process. But in simple cases, you can be the one to directly guide the building process using the builder.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Simple Example: Building a House</h2>
<p>Let's say you're building a house. You have two main things that every house must have:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A foundation (e.g., made of concrete).</li>
    <li>A structure (e.g., made of wood or brick).</li>
</ul>
<p>But you also have optional things like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A garden.</li>
    <li>A swimming pool.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Instead of creating a house with a long list of parameters (where you have to pass values for everything, 
    even if you don't need them), you can build the house step by step using a builder.
